# Application State with Redux

Overview
- **Managing state** with **Redux** requires the **combination of 3 distinct aspects** into a ***“Store”*** which all components can access as they please.
  1. **State**
  2. **Reducers** (strategies to alter state)
  3. **Actions** (methods that get “dispatched” or “run”, which trigger associated reducers)

## Redux Store

- **Store** where state is stored. 
  - **identifies** the various **reducers** and **middleware** that need to be *made available* and *used globally*.
  - **entire app needs** to be given **access** to the store. 
    - provider wrapper

          import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

          return (
            <Provider store={store}>
             <React.Fragment>
                <App />
             </React.Fragment>
           </Provider>
          )

    - redux connect() method 

          import { connect } from 'react-redux';

          export default connect(
            mapStateToProps,
            mapDispatchToProps,
          )(App);

- **Reducers** hold and manage state. 
  - typically **manage** *just one part* of the larger application state. 
    - Example: in a storefront application, likely have a separate reducer for Products, Categories, and Carts
  - *always **“Hear”*** that an *action was dispatched*, and use whatever **“payload”** they receive *to do their work*.
-  with Redux dispatch **“actions” (like an event)** with **"payload” (data)**. 

- An **action creator function** always **returns an action object** with the action **type** to perform and the **payload** to perform it with.
  - To modify state, **“Dispatch”** (call) an action
  - a **reducer responds** to it, and receives that payload, where it then operates on state using it.

- **store** to *“bring it all together”* - in the store, declare what middleware you may need and the reducers that you’ll use to manage your state data


      import React from 'react';
      import { connect } from 'react-redux';

      import * as actions from '../store/actions.js';

      class App extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
        }

        render() {
          return (
            <button onClick={this.props.initializeTheCart}>
              Start Shopping!
            </button>
          );
        }
      }

      const mapStateToProps = state => ({
        cart: state.cart,
      });

      const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, getState) => ({
        initializeTheCart: () => dispatch(actions.newCart()),
      });

      export default connect(
        mapStateToProps,
        mapDispatchToProps,
      )(App);
