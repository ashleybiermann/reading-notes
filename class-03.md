### HTML & CSS
Vocab
- **definition lists** another kind of list. &lt;dl> *definition list*  &lt;dt> *definition term*  &lt;dd> *definition*
- **border** separates the edge of one box from another *p 307*
- **margin** sits outside the edge of the border *p 307*
- **padding** space between the border and any content inside of it *p 307*

*Remember...*
- If you specify a *width* for a box, then **borders**, **margain**, and **padding** are added to its width and height
- CSS treats each *HTHM element* as if it were in its *own box*

Noteworthy
- lists can be put inside of a list item, called **nested lists**
- *hide information* with CSS tags (such as class="coming-soon" | .coming-soon **{visibility: hidden;}**

### JavaScript
Vocab
- **switch statements** switch() {}  *p 164*
- **case** what a **switch** needs for each possible case
- **truthy** treated as if they were true *p 167*
- **fasly** treated as if they were false

*Remember...*
- there needs to be a *break;* at the end of each case
- there is a *default*, like a catch-all, at the end of the **switch** to catch the things not caught in the **cases**

Noteworthy
- **if...else** statements run code for true / false | **switch** statements compares a value against possible outcomes
- keyword "*break*" tells interpreter to leave loop and go on to the next thing
- keyword "*continue*" tells interpreter to *stop* current iteration, then update and check the condition again
