## Advanced Mongo/Mongoose

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
   - get the data in a most desirable way

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  - Create , Read , Update , Delete (four basic types of SQL commands)

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
  - Postgres: SQL  __   MongoDB: NoSQL

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
  - an ORM, 'translates' data from JS to what MondoDB wants

5. Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
  - they can handle increased traffic by adding more servers to the database   [BMC Blog](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/sql-vs-nosql/#:~:text=The%20Scalability&text=In%20contrast%2C%20NoSQL%20databases%20are,or%20constantly%20evolving%20data%20sets.)

6. Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
  - NoSql: can handle more data by just adding more servers, so it works well for large or constantly evolving data
  - Sql: table based-structure, so it works better with apps that require multi-row transactions, such as accounting systems orlegacy systems built around a relational structure

7. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
  - Name, Phone number, Address. Each phone number belongs to a name. Each address belongs to a name.

8. Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
  - MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis

### Vocab

- **database** - a place to store informtion, could be locally or remotely
- **data model** - what the organization of my data looks like
- **CRUD** - four basic types of SQL commands: Create , Read , Update , Delete
- **schema** - blueprint for how database is constructed
- **sanitize** - when data is removed and absolutely no trace is left behind
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)** - relational database, table-based
- **Non SQL (NoSQL)** - non-relational database
- **MongoDB** - a NoSQL database, document-based
- **Mongoose** - ORM for interacting with MongoDB
- **record** - an entry in a database
- **document** - each record in a collection, in document database models like MongoDB
- **Object Relation Mapping (ORM)** - takes one set of data and maps it over to another type of data
