## Implementation: Stacks and Queues

## Stacks
- **Stack** data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous
1. **Push** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2. **Pop** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3. **Top** - This is the top of the stack.
4. **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5. **IsEmpty** - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

**FILO**
*First In Last Out*
- **first item added** in the stack will be the **last item popped out** of the stack

**LIFO**
*Last In First Out*
- **last item added** to the stack will be the **first item popped out** of the stack.

**O(1) Exampes of each...**
- Push
- Pop
- Peek
- IsEmpty

## Queues

- **Enqueue** - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- **Dequeue** - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **Front** - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- **Rear** - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

**FIFO**
*First In First Out*
- **first item in** the queue will be the **first item out** of the queue.

**LILO**
*Last In Last Out*
- **last item in** the queue will be the **last item out** of the queue.

**O(1) Examples of each...**
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek
- IsEmpty
