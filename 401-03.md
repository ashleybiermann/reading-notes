## Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

1. Why would a developer choose to make data models?
  - 

2. What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  - Create , Read , Update , Delete (four basic types of SQL commands)

3. What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
  - Postgres: SQL  __   MongoDB: NoSQL

4. What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
  - 
5. Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

#### Resources
There are a few alternatives to running Mongo locally for your web servers

- [MLab](https://www.mlab.com/) - remotely hosted mongoDB systems. Easily setup a free database (or pay for more horsepower). Works great with Heroku
- [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Cloud based, highly scalable Mongo DB
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) - AWS NoSQL Database. Very highly scalable. Also provides a ‘mongoose’-like ORM called ‘dynamoose’
- [CosmosDB](https://cosmos.azure.com/) - The Microsoft Azure equivalent for Atlas and Dynamo
