# Event Driven Applications

## Event Driven Programming

**Event Driven Programming** makes use of the following concepts:
- An **event handler** is a *callback function* that is called when event happens
- A **Main Loop** *listens* for event triggers and *calls* the associated event handler

How do we leverage this is in a software application?
- *Everything* in JS is an *object*, and *most actions* in JS are *event driven*

Node.js natively provides with us a module **EventEmitter** that allows us to incorporate EDP

Emitting Events
- `emit` - I just did something and I want the whole world to know about it! 
  - This will send a message out
- `events.on` - Something happened that I care about, and I want to do something now.
  - This will listen for that message
- `removeListener` - Removes a listener, but you must be **able to reference** it in your code at the point you want to remove it, because you have to pass a reference to the **exact function**
  - *Avoid nesting* event listeners inside of *functions* that *also handle other* things. It makes it really difficult to every remove them
- **Event Driven** programming *allows us to just emit events* that need listening to, rather then requiring the object that needs them to go reaching inside of another object to find it
