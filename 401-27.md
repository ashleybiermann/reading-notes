# Context API

## Context
- Provides a **means of passing state down** the component tree through a *Provide/Consumer* relationship
- a **“provider”** can **make it’s state available**, along with **means of altering it** (*methods*).
- At the lower levels, any *component* can *“opt-in”* and become a **“consumer”** and **receive this.state** from context.
