# Trees

## Common Terminology
- **Node** A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- **Root** The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- **Left Child** The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- **Right Child** The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- **Edge** The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- **Leaf** A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- **Height** The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

### Traversals

#### Depth First
  - prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first
  - uses a **stack**

#### Breadth First
- iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node
- uses a **queue**

### Binary Trees
- children are limited to **two**
- Addind a node - doesn't really matter where it is placed!
- One strategy: fill the child spots top down  
**Big O**
- **Adding** new node - **O(n)**
- **Searching** for a specific node - **O(n)**
  - Tree has n nodes, and in the worst case is we have to look through them all once

### Binary **Search** Tree (BST)
- **does have** some **structure**
- Values **smaller** than the root go **left**
- **larger** than the root go **right**
- Searching a BST: Start at root, compare smaller or larger, and go left or right
- **Big O**
- **Insertion** and **Search** - **O(h)**, where h is height
  - *balanaced* tree - **log(n)**
  - *unbalanced* tree - **h**
- space **complexity** - **O(1)** - during a search, we are *not allocating any additional space*

#### Resources

- [Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)  - has good visual examples, pseudocode, and code
