# Redux - Combined Reducers
Combined Reducers
- pulling in **more than one reducer from source** and **creating a keyed object** from them.

We do this because...
  - Obey the **Single Responsibility Principle**
    - **Each reducer** really should have **only 1 part of state** to manage
  - Allows for **decoupling** of logic
  
Actions
  - *Each reducer* technically *has it’s own actions and creators*.
  - *However*, they can **cross over** and **both be dispatched**.
    - Example: If an *action* of type ‘RESET’ is ever dispatched by any action creator, **both of the reducers would** actually **respond**.

          //counter.store.js
          export default function reducer (state = initialState, action) {
            switch (action.type) {
              case 'INCREMENT':
                return { value: state.value + 1 }
              case 'RESET':
                return {value:0};
              default:
                return state;
            }
          }

          //history.store.js
          export default function reducer (state = initialState, action) {
            switch (action.type) {
              case 'CLICK':
                return { clicks: state.clicks + 1 }
              case 'RESET':
                return {clicks:0};
              default:
                return state;
            }
          }
