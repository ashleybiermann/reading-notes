### [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
Resist the urge to write code as soon as possible
Do this by:
  1. Read the problem completely twice.
  2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
  3. Optimize the manual steps.
  4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  6.   Optimize the real code.
  **As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.**

...and Youâ€™ll Become 100x More Productive
Key take aways: 
- Prioritize your time, it is valuable! Don't just give it away to anyone that asks
- Be *focused*, not *busy*
- Recognize what is valuable
- Reflect - "Was it worth $1000 an hour?"

### [How to think like a programmer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)
Key take aways:
- Have a framework for solving problems, rather than just trying out possible solutions and hoping for the best
- **have a framework, practice it**
- Practice lots!
Steps:
1. Undestand - say it back in plain English
2. Plan - sudo code, comments
3. Divide - break into little sub problems
4. Stuck? - be *curious*, not *irritated*. Try: a. debug, b. reassess, c. research
