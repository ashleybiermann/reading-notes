# Message Queues

**Message Queues**
**Queue server** runs independently, tasked with routing events and messaging between clients
  - Any connected client can **“publish”** a message into the server
  - Any connected client can **“subscribe”** to receive messages by type.
- **Ability to** 
  - *see* which clients are *connected*
  - to *which Queues* they are *attached* 
  - to *which events* they are *subscribed*
- **Tasked with** 
  - *receiving* any published message and then *distributing* it out to all connected and subscribed clients. 
  - *ensure* that subscribed clients can *“catch up”* and pull down any messages that they might have missed during a period of disconnection with the server

Message
  - package of information, categorized by **queue** and **event**
    - **queue** - which general bucket does this message belong
    - **event** - what has happened
    - **payload** - data associated with event

**Real Time vs. Queued Messaging**
- Real time: gets missed if client is not connected at time fo event
- Queued: keeps track of messages and client can poll the server to retrieve messages at will
