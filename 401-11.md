# Authentication

## User Modeling

- Keep sensitive information secret
- **NEVER** send sensitive data to client applications

## Cryptography

- **cryptography**  science which studies methods for encoding messages
- Need to read that info? You'd need a **key** - tool to decode message
- **cryptanalysis**  science of decoding encrypted messages without having a key
- [GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English](http://gcide.gnu.org.ua/)

## Hash Algorithms

- takes in a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to reverse
- if an identical algorithm is passed into the same algorithm, the same hash is always produced
- server compares hashes

## Cypher Algorithms

- takes in a piece of data and a key and produced encrypted data
- the encrypted data can be reversed into the original data by using the same key
- User **tokens** can be created and associated with a user account, and encrypting the **tokenSeed** with a secret key that only the server knows
- then, send the token to the client application, and they send it back the next time, and the server decrypts it with the secret key

## Basic Authorization

- common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request
- base64
- server decodes and usually responds with some sort of validation response (token or key), so that the client can reauthenticate without having to continually send username:password
- `NOTE: base64 encoding is not a form of encryption. The client and server must use HTTPS to protect the username and password as it travels across the network.`
