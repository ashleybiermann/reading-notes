# Bearer Authorization

## Bearer Authentication

- *after* a sign in process (like Basic or OAuth), your service makes a boolean decision as to the success of the attempt
- successful! Let's make sure the *server just knows* this from now on
  - **bearer token** secondary authentication method
- **Bearer Token** encoded JSON object, contains enough info to show they it was authenticated thoroughly once before
  - sent to the client after initial, successful sign in process
  - every subsequent request must have the bearer token in the header
    - server looks at the token, makes a boolean
- in *express servers*, can be *middleware*

## JSON Web Tokens

- base-64 encoded, formatted like this: aaaaaa.bbbbbb.cccccc
  - a **header**
  - b **payload**
  - c **signature**
- **header**
  - alg: algorithm
  - typ: type of JWT token
- **payload** 
  - contains **claims**
- **signature** - combines the header with the payload, adds a secret, and base-64 encodes the whole thing
  - header
  - payload
  - secret

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

- **Authorization**
  - most common
  - small overhead
  - easily used across different domains
- **Information Exchange**
  - securely transfer info between two parties
  - with the **secret** signature, you can be sure someone is who they say they are
