# Component Based UI

## React Docs
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

- *building blocks* of React apps: **elements** and **components**
- We use **components** to tell React what we want to see on the screen. *When our data changes*, React will efficiently **update and re-render** our components.
- `props` (short for “properties”)
- The `render` method returns a *description* of what you want to see on the screen.

JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX. Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.

- React components can have **state** by setting `this.state` in their constructors
- Note
  - In JavaScript classes, you need to always call `super` when defining the `constructor` of a subclass. **All React component classes that have a constructor** should **start with** a `super(props)` call.

- It's conventional to use **`on[Event]`** names for **props**, and **`handle[Event]`** for the **methods**
