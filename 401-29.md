# Graphs

Definitions

- A **graph** is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of **`vertices`** (or **`nodes`**) potentially connected by **line segments** named **`edges`**.

- **Vertex** also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- **Edge**  connection between two nodes.
- **Neighbor** its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- **Degree** the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Undirected vs Directed

**Undirected**
- each **edge** is **undirected or bi-directional**
- *does not move in any direction*

**Directed**
- every **edge** is **directed**.
- aka **Diagraph**
- *has direction*
  - Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

**Complete**
- ***all*** nodes are **connected to all other nodes**

**Connected**
- ***all*** vertices/nodes have **at least one edge**

**Disconnected**
- ***some*** vertices may **not have edges**.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

**Acyclic** 
- directed graph without cycles.
- **d**irected **a**cyclic **g**raph is also called a **DAG**. This can also be represented as what we know as a *tree*.

**Cyclic**
- graph that has cycles.
- A **cycle** is defined as a path of a positive length that **starts and ends at the same vertex**

## Graph Representation
- Two Ways to represent:
1. Adjacency Matrix
  - **sparse graph** is when there are **very few connections**
  - **dense graph** is when there are **many connections**
2. Adjacency List
  - most common way to represent graphs
  - In code:
    1. We can visually see that we are working with a collection of some sort. The visual is depicting a Linked List, but you could easily make it an array of arrays if you’d like.
    2. Each index or node (depending on the data structure you choose to represent the adjacency list) will be a vertex within the graph.
    3. Every time you add an edge, you will find the appropriate vertices in the data structure and add it to the appropriate location.
- See link below for visual

## Weighted Graphs
- graph with **numbers assigned to its edges**
- These numbers are called **weights**.
- *adjacency lists*, you must include both the **weight** ***and*** the **name of the adjacent vertex**

## Traversals
Breadth First
- use a **Queue**
- is like that of a tree, with the exception that graphs **can have cycles**.
- to prevent an infinite loop -  need to have some sort of **visited** **flag** *(true/false)* that specifies if we have already visited that vertices.

Algorithm
1. Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
2. Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
3. Dequeue the first node from the queue
4. If the Dequeue‘d node has unvisited child nodes, mark the unvisited children as visited and re-insert them back into the queue.

        ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
            DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
            DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
            breadth.Enqueue(vertex)

            while (breadth is not empty)
                DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
                nodes.Add(front)

                for each child in front.Children
                    if(child is not visited)
                        child.Visited <-- true
                        breadth.Enqueue(child)   

            return nodes;

Depth First
- use a **Stack** for our depth-first traversal.

Algorithm
1. Push the root node into the stack
2. Start a while loop while the stack is not empty
3. Peek at the top node in the stack
4. If the top node has unvisited children, mark the top node as visited, and then Push any unvisited children back into the stack.
5. If the top node does not have any unvisited children, Pop that node off the stack
6. repeat until the stack is empty.

## Real World Uses of Graphs
- GPS and Mapping
- Driving Directions
- Social Networks
- Airline Traffic
- Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
