### Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
- browsers and node environments have different sets of tools

### What is the difference between a module and a package?
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20008442/difference-between-a-module-and-a-package-in-node-js#:~:text=A%20module%20is%20a%20single,has%20metadata%20about%20the%20package.)
**module** - single file
**package** - directory

### What does the node package manager do?
- lets you keep track of and choose which version of node to use

### Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

`module.exports = thingToExport;`

[GeeksForGeeks.com](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-export-module/)

module.exports = function (a, b) { 
  console.log(a + b); 
} 

module.exports = function () { 
  this.name = 'GeeksforGeeks'; 
  this.website = 'https://geeksforgeeks.org'; 
  this.info = () => { 
    console.log(`Company name - ${this.name}`); 
    console.log(`Website - ${this.website}`); 
  } 
}
