>What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office.
Teams need to feel phychologically safe to have a healthy work environment

>'The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. **REST** provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.'
**redirect** when one machine tells another machine where to find something it doesn't personally have, but knows where to find it
Language Comparison
- The URL lets all systems tell each other about their 'nouns', regardless of language
- *ploymorphism* different nouns can have the same verb applied to them
> 'HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns'
> 'Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH'
