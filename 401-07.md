## Express

**Express**
- *What is it?*
- **Library** designed to **create ReSTful API servers**; (route-handling library)
- *Goal*
- create a *non-opinionated API* (programable interface) to **handle HTTP request and response**
  - **non-opinionated** *doesn't prescribe* any workflow. Let's you own functions, and as long as **you handle request and response**, *it doesn't care* what you do

### Express Routing
**Routing**
- using a **function** to **handle incoming requests** (using the path and method). *Must utilize* the *response*
- **4 useful Request pieces:**
  1. request.path
  2. request.method
  3. request.headers
  4. request.body

### Express Middleware
- *In general...* code that **runs between other code**
- ***In Express*** function that sits between request and response
- It's creating a *linked-list* of nodes under the hood!
- **Order, place in code, matters. Put it in the top
- To **function as Express middleware**, we need *at least* 3 parameters:
  - such as `(request, response, next)`
  - or `(error, request, response)`

### Modularization & Separation of Concerns

### CRUD Operations with REST and Express
- CREATE `app.post(/resource)`
- READ `app.get(/resource)`
- UPDATE `app.put(/resource/:id)`
- DESTROY `app.get(/resource:id)`

### Server Testing

### Test Pyramid
- Server Testing crosses boundaries
  - Units: server interal functions
    - **Mock** any integrations (like a callback function)
  - Integration: how it connects to other servies
    - *Actually* connect to them, (hard dependencies)
  - Acceptance: the server might be a dependency of some other test
