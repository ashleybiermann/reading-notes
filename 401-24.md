# Hash Tables

Vocabulary
- **Hash** - the **result** of some algorithm **taking an incoming string** and **converting** it into a value that could be used for either **security** or some other purpose. 
  - In the case of a ***hashtable***, it is used to **determine the *index*** of the array.
- **Buckets** - **what is contained** in each **index** of the array of the **hashtable**. 
  - Each index is a bucket. 
  - An index could *potentially* contain *multiple key/value pairs* if a collision occurs.
- **Collisions** - what happens when **more than one key gets hashed to the same location** of the hashtable.

Hash Table Uses:
1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

Hashtables
- data structure that utilize **key value pairs**. 
- every `Node` or `Bucket` has both a key, and a value.
- **hash** ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure 

Big O Notation
- Search data *one by one* until it finds the one it wants, then returns the value. 
  - **O(N)** read operation because it requires searching through each piece of data to find the one piece we want
  - The reason it's O(N) isn’t because the array is slow, it’s that we have to look through all N things in the collection.
- *Arrays* have fast access. 
  - *O(1)* time, if we know the index of the information we want. 
- **Hash maps** *take advantage* of an array’s **O(1)** read access.
- **“hash function”** place each item at a *precise index location*, based off it’s key.
  - calculated in constant time and writing to an array at one index is O(1) so the hash map has O(1) access
- Calculating the hash code and reading an array at that index is all constant time so the **hash map has O(1) read access**!

Structure
- Hash codes *should never* have *randomness*. The **same key** should always produce the **same hash code**.

Collisions
- collision occurs *when more than one key* hashes to the same index in an array
- Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets. 
  - Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one! 

Bucket Sizes
- can have any number of buckets. 
  - only a few buckets? densely full and have many collisions. 
  - more buckets? sparsely populated, there will be fewer collisions, maybe a lot of extra empty space.

Internal Methods
- **Add()**
- **Find()**
- **Contains()**
- **GetHash()**
