# React Testing and Deployment

React Testing
- **Snapshots** - Make assertions on the exact rendered markup (with content) at any state of the application.
- **Render Testing** - Similar to snapshots, but allows for jQuery-like inspection of the virtual DOM tree
- **Shallow Testing** - Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose children.
- **Mounting** - Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state
- [Examples from Class Reading](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2061990/discussion_topics/9015291)

Deployment
- `npm run build` creates a *static website*, a deployable version of the code
  - contains no more than `index.html`, `.js`, `.css` file...wow!
