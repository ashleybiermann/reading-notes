## Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  - [knowledge hut resource](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/agile/6-compelling-benefits-of-tdd-test-driven-development#:~:text=TDD%20helps%20to%20create%20better%20modularized%2C%20extensible%20and%20flexible%20code,more%20focused%20on%20smaller%20unit.)
  - Prompt Feedback
  - Easy Anticipation & Identification of Voids
  - Programmers Feel More Confident By Continuous Achievement

2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  - if there was something that needed to be applied to all tests

3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - it feels slower at the beginning

4. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  - inheritance without need for prototypes

5. Name a use case for a static method
  - 'The static keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods aren't called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself. These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects.' [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static#:~:text=The%20static%20keyword%20defines%20a,to%20create%20or%20clone%20objects.)

6. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
  - -The map function is one of the many higher-order functions built into the language. sort, reduce, filter, forEach are other examples of higher-order functions built into the language.'

### Vocab
-**functional programming**   programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-programming-paradigm/)
- **pure function**  when a functions usability depends only on its inputs and no outside functions
- **higher-order function**  a function that either takes in another function or returns a function
- **immutable state**  something that can't be changed
- **object**  group of variables (key:valyes) and methods
- **object-oriented programming (OOP)**  programming that organizes around data, rather than function and logic [resource link](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP)
- **class**  values and methods that define objects , as 'animal' is to 'cat'
- **prototype**  a way of inhereting properties from something else
- **super**  keyword to access properties of a parent object
- **inheritance**  when class gains properties of another class in which it is a prototype of
- **constructor**  function to create instances of classes
- **instance**  an occurance of an object 
- **context**  the environment where something in located
- **this**  refers to the thing it is in, and in different contexts, could reference different things
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**  making tests first, and then writing code to pass them
- **Jest**  JS testing framework 
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**  when multiple code changes can be made into one project from many contributors
- **unit test**  a test for individual units or pieces of software
