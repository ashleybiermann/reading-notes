# `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

## Authentication + Role Based Authorization
- Why?
  1. Check for valid user (are they logged in?)
  2. Know what the use is allowed to do
    - Certain parts of app care about this
    - Determined by: Contents of Token, Contact between UI and API
  3. Make it easy to use

## Proposal
`<Auth />` Component
- Based on user permissions and login status, it *either* **gives user access to a component or jsx** *or* **hides it**.
- No Redux ... because donâ€™t want to force implementors into a specific state management system

      // The div only shows if you are logged in
        <Auth>
          <div />
        </Auth>

      // The div only shows if you are logged in AND have read permissions
        <Auth capability="read">
          <div />
        </Auth>
