## Express Routing & Connected API

**Routing** 
- how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests
- Can use **path-to-regexp** in paths to allow for flexibility
  - `('/ab?cd')`  matches `acd` and `abcd`
  - `('/ab+cd')`  matches `abcd` , `abbcd`, `abbbbbcd`
  - `('/ab*cd')`  allows for *random* whatever stuff to go there
  - `('/a(bc)?d')`  groups the `(bc)` together
  - `(/a/)`  match anything with 'a' in it
  - `(/.*fly$/)`  matches with 'fly' on the end, like butterfly, *not* butterflyman though
  - *see below resource for more examples*

  **Route Parameters**
  - Named **URL segments** that are used to **capture the values** specifiec at their position in the URL
    - captured values **live in req.params**, in **key:value pairs**
`Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId <br>
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989 <br>
req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }` <br>
- **path** server-side, **URL** browser-side

**Route Handlers**
- Provide **reference to a function** rather than writing it all in the app.get(), for example. 
- Can provide multiple functions that behave like middleware to handle a request

### Lecture *review*
**Routing**
- A **trail** with a **function** that will run, given the proper method, path, and headers
**Middleware**
- A piece of code that **runs in the middle of a request**
- We do **not** consider functions that **send a response** to be middleware
