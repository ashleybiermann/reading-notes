# Custom Hooks

- **custom hooks**  
  - extract duplicate logic from components
  - share common **functionality**, but *not* state
  - take advance of `useEffect` lifecycle

- Use Cases:
  1. handle forms easily
  2. pre-fetch API data
  3. connect to serves (like socket.io, etc)

- Think of it like a normal function:
  - doesn't need to have a specific signature
  - we decide what it takes as args
  - we decide if and what it should return
  - name should start with `use`

        use-food-hook.js

        export default function useFoodHook(hungry) {
          let food = 'cookies';
          return hungry ? food : null;
        }


        my-component.js

        import useFeedme from 'use-food-hook.js';
        function myComponent() {
          const food = useFeedMe(true);
          return <div>{food}</div>
        }
