# OAuth
- **Authorization** between two machines

## Roles

- **Resource** content that needs to be shared
- **Resource Owner** user who owns the resources
- **Resource Server** server that holds the resources
- **Authorization Server** server that presents the user with an interface to approve or deny authorization request

## Creating an App

- Register app with with the service
  - **basic info** like app name, website, logo
  - register a **redirect URI**
- **Redirect URIs**
  - service will *only redirect to registered* URIs
  - native apps *may* register a redirect URI with a *custom URL scheme* for the app
  - **Client ID and Secret**
    - you get an client ID (***public** info*), and maybe a secret (***confidential** info*), *after registering* your app
  
## Authorization

- **First Step**: Get **authorization** from the user 
- **Grant Types**
  - **Authorization Code** for apps running on *web server, browser based, and moblie*
  - **Password** *only* for *first-party apps*, for logging in with username and password
  - **Client credentials** for application access *without a user present* 
  - **Implicit** *previously* recommended for *clients without a secret*, but **now superseded** by using *Authorization Code grant* with PKCE

## Web Server Apps

- most common type of app to encounter when dealing with OAuth
- **response_type=code** indicate your server expects to recieve and auth code
- **client_id**- The client ID you received when you first created the application
- **redirect_uri** Indicates the URI to return the user to after authorization is complete
- **scope** - One or more scope values indicating which parts of the user's account you wish to access
- **state** - A random string generated by your application, which you'll verify later
- **code** - The server returns the authorization code in the query string
- **state** - The server returns the same state value that you passed

## Single Page Apps

- run entirely in the browser after loading the source code. Since the entire source code is availabel to the browser, a **secret is not used**

## Mobile Apps

- also cannot keep a secret
- uses the **PKCE flow**
